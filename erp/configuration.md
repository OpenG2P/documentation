Congratulations you have a brand new instance of OpenG2P running. However before you can begin using OpenG2P to manage your programs you first need to enable and configure features you will be using.

## Changing the Admin Password, Timezone, & Email

The docker installation method creates default login credential for you that is not secure and should be changed immediately after installation.

To change your password, in the top right corner of your screen, click on your name. From the submenu that opens up, click on the `Preferences` menu which should open your user preferences/settings.

The user preference popup also allows you to configure your timezone and email address.

Additionally, click on "Add States/District" (see image above) to add states or districts used as part of beneficiary addresses. These can be created one at a time by clicking `Create` or imported from a list by clicking `Import.` To learn more about importing data in OpenG2P ERP, see the [importing data guide](./guide/advanced/importing-data.md)

## Specify Beneficiary Locations

These are locations around which beneficiaries group, assigned, or associated with. Not necessarily geographical locations, it is best explained via examples.

- Example 1) A health workers payment program would have these locations as health centers in which health workers work from or are assigned to. Administrators or human resource managers at these locations, if provided access, can start enrollment and disenrollment workflows unbehalf of health workers assigned to their health centers.

- Example 2) A rural safety net transfer program in Sierra Leone would have this as chiefdoms and wards in which beneficiaries reside. District officers assigned to these chiefdom and wards can, if provided access, start enrollment and disenrollment workflows unbehalf of qualifying residents.

Locations supports hierarchical structures, one location can be a sub locations of another. All beneficiaries must be assigned to a location.

On the settings page `Beneficiaries/Configuration/Settings`, scroll down to the `Configurations` section and click on `Add Location`  to add your programs locations.

![settings-location](../images/settings-location.png){:width="50%"}

Location can be created one at a time by clicking `Create` or imported from a list by clicking `Import.` To learn more about importing data in OpenG2P ERP, see the [importing data guide](./advanced/importing-data.md)

![settings-location-list](../images/settings-location-list.png){:width="80%"}

You create a location by entering the name of the location in the location form. If this location is a sub-location of another already created, select that "parent" location using the `Parent Location` dropdown on the form.

## Generating Beneficiary Internal IDs

The ERP can assign internal IDs to beneficiaries if none is allocated while creating a beneficiary record. By default this ID is a random 8 digit number; however you can change the number of digits used or use an [Odoo sequence](https://www.cybrosys.com/blog/how-to-add-sequence-in-odoo-12_) for generation.

On the OpenG2P settings page `Beneficiaries/Configuration/Settings`, scroll down to the `Beneficiary Identification` section to change how these internal IDs are generated.

![setting-beneficiary-id](../images/setting-beneficiary-id.png){:width="50%"}

## Beneficiary External IDs

Programs can specify external identification schemes that they support. These are usually government schemes like national IDs, passport, and driving license. The aforementioned comes by default with OpenG2P installations, however adopters can add to the list of supported. We advice that supported IDs are unique and comply with the financial sector KYC minimums for that territory.

On the OpenG2P settings page `Beneficiaries/Configuration/Settings`, scroll down to the `Beneficiary Identification` and click on `Add External Identification`
